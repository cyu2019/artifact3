	<h1>About Larry Woiwode</h1>
	<p>
	Woiwode was born on October 30, 1941, in Carrington, North Dakota, spending his early childhood on the North Dakota plains before moving to Illinois, where he spent his adolescence and attended the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign from 1959 to 1964. Throughout high school and university, he published poems and short stories before his breakout novel <i>What I'm going to do, I think</i> in 1969. Woiwode has continued to publish works from all spheres of writing, including but not limited to poetry, fiction, critical essays, and memoirs. He later moved back to North Dakota was designated its Poet Laureate in 1995.

	<p>
	As Poet Laureate of North Dakota, Woiwode is a critically acclaimed author of novels, short stories, poetry, and critical essays. He is known for a very grounded and realistic style, with the content and settings of his works tied to his real life experiences and past. He attributes his shift towards this style of writing from a more postmodern and surreal style to a  conversation he had with William Maxwell, an editor for <i>The New Yorker</i>, early in his career.

	In this way, this exhibit aims to contextualize Woiwode's realistic style by viewing his poems through the eyes of a computer, allowing you to view Woiwode's work through something of an objective lens.
